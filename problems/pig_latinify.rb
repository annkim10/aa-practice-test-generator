# Write a method that translates a sentence into pig latin. You may want a helper method.

## Rules
# Pig latin translation uses the following rules:
# - for words that start with a vowel, add 'ay' to the end
# - for words that start with a nonvowel, move all letters before the first vowel to the end of the word and add 'ay'
# - 'qu' counts as a consonant (see third example)

## Examples
# 'apple' => 'appleay'
# 'pearl' => 'earlpay'
# 'quick' => 'ickquay'
def pig_latinify(sentence)
